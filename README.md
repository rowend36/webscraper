This project is an exploration of what can be done with webscraping in python.
It explores differnet techniques including regular expressions, dom parsing, controlled execution of javascript etc in order to get proper information from different real-world websites.
While there are a lot of tutorials on webscraping, this intends to be a sort of __cookbook__ except that the __book__ is being released even before the <b>cook</b>ing starts.
